    <h1 class="text-center py-5">Leigh Syndrome</h1>
    <img class="w-100 h-25" src="{% static 'images/Down syndrome.jpg' %}" alt="Leigh Syndrome" />
    <h2>Cause</h2>
    <p>
      Leigh syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive
      neurological deterioration. It is caused by mutations in nuclear DNA or
      mitochondrial DNA, affecting mitochondrial function and energy
      production in cells.
    </p>
    <h5>1. Mitochondrial DNA Mutations</h5>
    <p>
      Many cases of Leigh syndrome are caused by mutations in mitochondrial
      DNA (mtDNA). These mutations affect the function of mitochondria, which
      are responsible for producing energy in cells.
    </p>

    <h5>2. Nuclear DNA Mutations</h5>
    <p>
      Some forms of Leigh syndrome result from mutations in nuclear DNA, which
      contains the genetic information for cellular functions outside of the
      mitochondria. These mutations can also disrupt mitochondrial function
      and energy production.
    </p>

    <h5q>3. Inherited or Sporadic Mutations</h5q>
    <p>
      Leigh syndrome can be inherited in an autosomal recessive, autosomal
      dominant, or X-linked manner, depending on the specific genetic mutation
      involved. In some cases, mutations may occur sporadically without a
      family history of the condition.
    </p>

    <h5>4. Biochemical Defects</h5>
    <p>
      The genetic mutations associated with Leigh syndrome lead to biochemical
      defects in mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, particularly
      complex I (NADH dehydrogenase). This disruption in energy metabolism
      contributes to the neurological symptoms of the disorder.
    </p>

    <h5>5. Mitochondrial Dysfunction</h5>
    <p>
      Overall, Leigh syndrome is characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction,
      impaired energy production, and oxidative stress within cells. These
      cellular abnormalities underlie the clinical features and progression of
      the disease.
    </p>
    <h2>Genetic Incidence</h2>
    <p>
      Leigh syndrome can be inherited in an autosomal recessive or X-linked
      recessive pattern, depending on the gene involved.
    </p>
    <h5>1. Autosomal Recessive Inheritance</h5>
    <p>
      Many cases of Leigh syndrome are inherited in an autosomal recessive
      manner. This means that an affected individual inherits two copies of a
      mutated gene (one from each parent). Carriers of one mutated gene copy
      are typically asymptomatic.
    </p>

    <h5>2. Autosomal Dominant Inheritance</h5>
    <p>
      In rare cases, Leigh syndrome can be inherited in an autosomal dominant
      manner. This means that a single copy of the mutated gene, inherited
      from one parent, is sufficient to cause the condition. Individuals with
      autosomal dominant Leigh syndrome have a 50% chance of passing the
      mutation to each of their offspring.
    </p>

    <h5>3. X-Linked Inheritance</h5>
    <p>
      Some forms of Leigh syndrome are inherited in an X-linked manner. This
      means that the mutated gene responsible for the condition is located on
      the X chromosome. Males with an X-linked mutation are more severely
      affected, while females may be carriers or exhibit milder symptoms due
      to X-inactivation.
    </p>

    <h5>4. Sporadic Mutations</h5>
    <p>
      In addition to inherited forms, Leigh syndrome can also occur due to
      sporadic mutations that arise spontaneously in an individual's genetic
      material. These mutations may occur in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or
      nuclear DNA and are not inherited from parents.
    </p>

    <h2>Treatment</h2>
    <p>
      There is no cure for Leigh syndrome. Treatment focuses on managing
      symptoms and providing supportive care, such as physical therapy,
      respiratory support, and nutritional support.
    </p>
    <h5>1. Symptomatic Management</h5>
    <p>
      Currently, there is no cure for Leigh syndrome. Treatment primarily
      focuses on managing symptoms and improving quality of life.
    </p>

    <h5>2. Supportive Care</h5>
    <p>
      Patients with Leigh syndrome often require supportive care to address
      specific needs. This may include respiratory support, physical therapy,
      occupational therapy, and nutritional support.
    </p>

    <h5>3. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)</h5>
    <p>
      Some studies have suggested that supplementation with Coenzyme Q10
      (CoQ10) may have beneficial effects on mitochondrial function and energy
      production in certain cases of Leigh syndrome. However, more research is
      needed to determine its effectiveness.
    </p>

    <h5>4. Thiamine (Vitamin B1) Therapy</h5>
    <p>
      Thiamine (Vitamin B1) therapy may be considered in individuals with
      Leigh syndrome caused by specific genetic mutations that affect thiamine
      metabolism. However, its efficacy varies depending on the underlying
      genetic defect.
    </p>

    <h5>5. Mitochondrial Cocktail</h5>
    <p>
      Some healthcare providers may prescribe a combination of vitamins and
      supplements, often referred to as a "mitochondrial cocktail," to support
      mitochondrial function and energy production. This cocktail may include
      CoQ10, thiamine, riboflavin, and other nutrients.
    </p>

    <h5>6. Genetic Counseling</h5>
    <p>
      Genetic counseling is crucial for families affected by Leigh syndrome.
      It provides information about the genetic basis of the condition,
      inheritance patterns, family planning options, and available support
      resources.
    </p>
    <h2>Tips to Reduce Symptoms</h2>
    <p>
      Since Leigh syndrome is a genetic disorder, there are no specific tips
      to reduce symptoms. Early diagnosis and supportive care are key to
      managing the condition.
    </p>
    <h5>1. Regular Medical Monitoring</h5>
    <p>
      Keep up with regular medical check-ups and monitoring to track the
      progression of Leigh syndrome and manage symptoms effectively.
    </p>

    <h5>2. Supportive Care</h5>
    <p>
      Work with healthcare professionals to develop a comprehensive plan for
      supportive care, which may include physical therapy, occupational
      therapy, and speech therapy to address specific symptoms and improve
      quality of life.
    </p>

    <h5>3. Respiratory Support</h5>
    <p>
      Individuals with respiratory issues due to Leigh syndrome may benefit
      from respiratory support devices such as ventilators or BiPAP machines
      to assist with breathing.
    </p>

    <h5>4. Nutritional Support</h5>
    <p>
      Ensure proper nutrition by working with a dietitian to develop a
      balanced diet tailored to the individual's needs. This may include
      supplements or specialized formulas if swallowing or feeding
      difficulties arise.
    </p>

    <h5>5. Manage Seizures</h5>
    <p>
      If seizures are a symptom of Leigh syndrome, work with neurologists to
      develop a seizure management plan, which may include medication and
      lifestyle modifications.
    </p>

    <h5>6. Monitor Medications</h5>
    <p>
      Keep track of medications and their effects, and communicate regularly
      with healthcare providers to adjust dosages or switch medications if
      needed to manage symptoms effectively.
    </p>

    <h5>7. Genetic Counseling</h5>
    <p>
      Seek genetic counseling for families affected by Leigh syndrome to
      understand the genetic basis of the condition, inheritance patterns,
      family planning options, and available support resources.
    </p>
    <h2>Latest Research</h2>
